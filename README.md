## Summary

This repository contains all the details for an absolute beginner to get started with the DE10-Nano.

## FAQ

### Isn't there documentation already? Why this doc?

There is a lot of documentation online, but unfortunately very few tutorials and docs are available which cater to the absolute beginner.

## Prerequisites

This document assumes no knowledge of FPGAs. However, it requires a few things for you to be able to follow along:

 * **DE10-Nano**: Obviously you need the DE10-Nano board. Most prominent electronics retailers stock it (digikey, mouser, element14) or you can purchase it directly from the Terasic website. Please don't purchase knock-offs or cheap alternatives. FPGA programming is hard enough and there are a million things that can go wrong.
 * **Working knowledge of Linux**: Linux will be the preferred OS for this guide. You should be able to navigate the terminal and know at least the basic commands of the shell.
