## Summary

Here, we'll go through all the steps with as much detail as possible to explain all the steps to get our very simple and very basic SoC project running. This is going to be a simple hardware adder.

Since there will be a lot of steps involved, we'll break it up into several sections to make it easier to follow. Use the links in the menu on the right to navigate.

Note that you will need to have setup the development environment and should be using the debian OS either by building it on your own using the sections on the right or by downloading one of the ready to use images from the releases page.

When you're ready, go ahead to the Initial project setup.

[Playing with the Cyclone V SoC on the DE0-Nano-SoC](https://digibird1.wordpress.com/playing-with-the-cyclone-v-soc-system-de0-nano-soc-kitatlas-soc/) - The idea of the Simple Adder, how to use parallel IOs and using the heavyweight HPS-to-FPGA bus are all explained here and was instrumental in putting a lot of this content together. If you haven't seen it, I highly recommend going through. They talk about many other features also such as DMA etc which I hope to learn and include here at some point.
